# Blackjack desktop game
**You can find an .exe file to play the game under bin/Debug.**

First a loading screen will meet you but it is not real, it is just for 4 secs but we wanted to make it because we wanted to practice.

Then you will reach to the main menu and you will see 3 buttons to start the game, to see card values and to quit the game and there is a speaker icon for turning off music but it does not work exactly because if you turn off the music, still music will start again in game we could not solve this problem :(

Now if we click on the start button we will start the game, but firstly we need to choose card style, we added this feature because we wanted to add variation.

After choosing card style, finally we can start the game by clicking start button, then we can bet, at the start we have 2000$ to bet, but you can bet 0$ if you want.

### Game

Now it gives you 2 cards and same for computer, your goal is reaching to 21 but that is not easy because if you over the 21 you lose.
Also let's say you stood on the 18 because it is risky, if you hit maybe you can over the 21, and computer's hand is 19 you lose.
You can check card values from the start menu because there are tricky cards like A,J,K,Q.
These cards have special values so you need to learn them.
Enjoy :)

At the bottom, you can go to main menu, change the card style, quit the game and change the background.
For background there are some colors and 3 pictures but we recommend to use color background because if you choose pictures the animation of giving cards is breaking :/
